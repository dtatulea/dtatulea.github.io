Hi. Welcome to my Geociti...ahem...github page.

I'm a software engineer interested in systems programming and networking. I don't like to build stuff. I like to work and enhance stuff that already exists.

When I'm not in front of the screen you can find me on my [zafu](https://joyfullotus.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/zazen6.jpg), [yoga mat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtanga_vinyasa_yoga) or driking a Flat White.
